Android and Senior Android Engineer
==================================

Babylon aims to hire only the most qualified people available for the 
job at any given time. That doesn't mean that a candidate must have 
several academic degrees or have years and years of experience. 
We value potential equally as much as knowledge and experience. 
Above all, we value one's ability to think independently and to engage.

Additionally, we want to hire people who are reasonable, professional, 
and fun to work with. After all, they are people we will spend a great 
deal of time interacting with on a daily basis.

We are continually improving how we work remotely as a company and aim 
to be as flexible as possible by equally accepting applications from 
candidates who want to work on-site at our office in London, or who 
want to work remotely.

At Babylon, we also believe in/champion diversity and welcome everyone 
from everywhere. Currently in the Android team you'll find people from

#### Interview Structure

The interview process for the Android and Senior Android Engineer roles
generally consists in the stages/sessions below. 1 and 2 always happen
off-site and from 3-7 depending if you're based around London or not,
some of the sessions might happen remotely as well but they usually
happen in a half day on-site visit. 

Check our [interview stages page](../interview_stages) for a brief 
description of each of the stages/sessions.
 
1. [Initial phone call](../interview_stages.md#initial-phone-call)
2. [Code challenge](../interview_stages.md#code-challenge)
3. [UI interview](../interview_stages.md#ui-interview)
4. [Architecture interview](../interview_stages.md#architecture-interview)

6. [Programming exercise](../interview_stages.md#programming-exercise)
7. [Final interview](../interview_stages.md#final-interview) 

We try to maintain the structure order above, but it might be the case 
where we have to slightly change it due to availability of the participants. 
In each session you'll have the chance to ask questions as well, so take
that opportunity to find out as much as you can about us and the way 
we work, we'll be happy to answer those questions.
