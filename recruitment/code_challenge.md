Babylon Android Tech Test
==================================

As mentioned in the main page, our tech test consists in building a simple app where you can demonstrate all your potential as an Android Engineer.

The app should have two screens, as follows:
- A screen with a list of clickable posts with at least the post title
- A detail screen for the selected post with at least the follow:
    - Post title
    - Post body
    - Author name
    - Number of comments

You can fetch all the required data from the following API endpoints:
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments 
 
Feel free to add more things to the app using the other available APIs 
or `https://api.adorable.io/avatars` to generate a random avatar for the posts authors.

### Guidelines
- Use of 3rd party libraries (and dependency management) is accepted and encouraged
- We consider tests to be as important as functional code. So we expect you to show that you know how to unit test your code.  
- The tech test needs to compile from the command line so that we can build it ourselves.

If you're short on time, you can either pick the route of implementing a simple architecture and focus more on the UI (animations, transitions etc), 
or go for a simple UI and focus more on the architecture of the application. Please let us know which one you prefer of the 2 options and why.

We're not in a hurry, so if you prefer to take your time and deliver in both fronts we're more than happy to wait :)
