Babylon Android Tech Test
==================================

As part of the interview process we'd love to see your code!
If you have a pet project or an open source contribution that you believe demonstrates your
knowledge as an Android Engineer, and you're comfortable sharing it with us, please do and we'll
look at that. If you have nothing that you can share we prepared the sample coding exercise below to
demonstrate your knowledge of architecture, design patterns and Android UI components.

The app should have two screens, as follows:
- A screen with a list of clickable posts with at least the post title
- A detail screen for the selected post with at least the follow:
    - Post title
    - Post body
    - Author name
    - Number of comments

You can fetch all the required data from the following API endpoints:
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

### Guidelines
- We know creating polished apps takes time, time you may not necessarily have as you search for
  a new job, so as a guideline we ask that you don't spend any more that 8 hours maximum on this. If there are things you would add given more time, tell us about them in a comment.
- Use of 3rd party libraries (and dependency management) is accepted
  and encouraged
- We consider tests to be as important as functional code. So we 
  expect you to show that you know how to unit test your code. This need not be full coverage given
  the time constraint, one or two tests demonstrating your abilities will suffice!
- The tech test needs to compile so that we can build it ourselves.

If you're short on time, you can either pick the route of implementing 
a simple architecture and focus more on the UI (animations, transitions
etc), or go for a simple UI and focus more on the architecture of the 
application. Please let us know which one you prefer of the 2 options
and why.
