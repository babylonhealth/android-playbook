Interview stages
==================================

Depending on the [position](./positions/open_positions.md) you're applying to, our
recruitment process involves a combination of different interview stages and
sessions described below. Don't get scared with the huge list below :), 
you can find the structure for your interview in the `Interview structure` 
section of the position you're applying to.

#### Initial phone call 

**Structure:** 30' with a Recruiter

This consists an introductory phone call where we get to 
know you and understand your background and intentions to join Babylon. 
This session is not technical.
 
#### Code challenge
The 2nd stage of our interview process is a coding exercise/challenge, which 
consists of building a simple Android application to demonstrate your knowledge 
around architecture, design patterns and Android UI components.
You can find our code challenge here -> [Android code challenge](code_challenge.md)

If you have a pet project or an open source contribution that you believe 
demonstrates your knowledge as an Android Engineer, and you're comfortable 
sharing it with us, please do and we'll evaluate that instead. It might 
happen we don't find that enough and still ask you for the code challenge, 
so try to send something relevant.

#### UI interview

**Structure:** 45' with 2 Android engineers

A session more focused in Android UI and the Android framework 
components. [Possible questions](design_questions.md)

#### Architecture interview

**Structure:** 45' with 2 Android engineers

A session around Android architecture, design patterns and common libraries used 
within Android development. [Possible questions](architecture_questions.md)

#### Architecture and UI interview

**Structure:** 60' with 2 Android engineers

A combination of the 2 sessions above into one.

**For candidates not in London, these 3 sessions above can happen remotely 
before we fly you in for the rest of the process**

#### Working with Design and Product

**Structure:** 30' with a Designer and a Product Manager

A session about design and product management and how
you generally work and interact with members from both of those teams. 

#### Programming exercise

**Structure:** 60' with an Android Engineer or Lead

In this session you'll be given a small problem to solve that will involve 
cloning a code base with the problem skeleton and implementing a solution 
to make existing tests in the project pass. This will be done using Android 
tudio and the skeleton is written in Kotlin, so preferably your solution
should be written in Kotlin as well. You will need to bring your laptop 
for this session.

#### Team presentation

**Structure:** 70' with 4-6 people from different teams

During the initial stages you'll be asked to prepare a presentation about
a specific problem/challenge. In this session you'll be able to present it
and discuss it with different people in the company from Leads, Engineers,
Designers and Product for example. This session is typically part of the
Lead interview process.

#### Product interview

**Structure:** 45' with a Product Manager or Product Owner

This is a more detailed session about product management and you work and
interact with members of that team. This session is typically part of the
Lead interview process.

#### Cultural interview

**Structure:** 45' with an Engineering Manager from another team

This is a typical cultural fit session led by an Engineering Manager not
part of the Android team. This session is typically part of the
Lead interview process.

#### Final interview

**Structure:** 30' with an Android Lead or the Director of Engineering

This is the final session and consists of a talk around a general technical 
topic, like a previous project you have worked on. You'll also talk about
your motivations to join Babylon and your preferred ways of working and 
what you're looking for in a company. It's important that you have an 
active role in this discussion and ask questions back.
