Android Playbook 📚
==================================

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that 
should be present in everything we do. This public playbook is here to 
serve as both a guide and reference for the current team, new joiners 
and for anyone else who want's to learn a little bit more about who are, 
what we do and how we work. This playbook will continuously be updated as
we go, so be sure to check back often!

## Who are we and what are we currently working on?

There are currently 27 of us in the Android team, but as an Android 
Engineer you'll be joining a smaller, cross-functional squad made up of 
Android, iOS, web and backend engineers.  You'll get the chance to 
collaborate with designers, product managers and healthcare 
professionals, tackling complex, exciting problems on a daily basis. 

You can check who we are and which squads we're working on below. By 
definition, members work on their respective squad, although they are 
free to work in different squads if the work load justifies it.

We are now split into 2 offices, one in South Kensington (HQ) and 
another one in Liverpool Street. We have open positions in both 
locations, links in the end. The distribution between both offices is 
based on which tribe/squad you work on.

We're passionate about our codebase and are always looking for 
innovative ways to build fast.  All our new code is written in 
Kotlin and we use an MVI architecture with Rx and Dagger to help us 
write high-quality, testable code. We currently have over 20,000 
tests and counting!

As a team, we love to learn and often participate in Lunch and Learn 
sessions with other Android developers and the wider tech community. 
For example we've given talks at Droidcon London and Londroid.
