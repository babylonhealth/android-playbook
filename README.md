Android Playbook ðŸ“š
==================================

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do, and hiring the best person should reflect that belief. So, following our [iOS](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/ios-playbook) colleagues, we also decided to open-source our recruitment process, for a fairer assessment in which candidates know exactly what to expect.

We want you to know us, what we're working on, and what we expect from you if you apply to Babylon to become part of our Android Team.

## Who are we and what are we currently working on?

There are currently 16 of us in the Android team, but as an Android Engineer you'll be joining a smaller, 
cross-functional squad made up of Android, iOS, web and backend engineers.  You'll get the chance to collaborate with designers, product managers and healthcare professionals, tackling complex, exciting problems on a daily basis. 

You can check who we are and which squads we're working on below. By definition, members work on their respective squad, although they are free to work in different squads if the work load justifies it.

We are now split into 2 offices, one in South Kensington (HQ) and another one in Liverpool Street. We have open positions in both locations, links in the end. The distribution between both offices is based on which tribe/squad you work on.

We're passionate about our codebase and are always looking for innovative ways to build fast.  All our new code is written in Kotlin and we use an MVI architecture with Rx and Dagger to help us write high-quality, testable code. We currently have over 11,000 tests and counting!

As a team, we love to learn and often participate in Lunch and Learn sessions with other Android developers and the wider tech community. For example we've given talks at Droidcon London and Londroid.

If you share our passions and want to join the team, check out how our recruitment process works below.

## Recruitment process

Babylon aims to hire only the most qualified people available for the job at any given time. That doesn't mean that a candidate must have several academic degrees or have years and years of experience. We value potential equally as much as knowledge and experience. Above all, we value one's ability to think independently and to engage.

Additionally, we want to hire people who are reasonable, professional, and fun to work with. After all, they are people we will spend a great deal of time interacting with on a daily basis.

We are continually improving how we work remotely as a company and aim to be as flexible as possible by equally accepting applications from candidates who want to work on-site at our office in London, or who want to work remotely.

At Babylon we also believe in/champion diversity and welcome everyone from everywhere. Currently in the Android team you'll find people from Greece, Poland, UK, India, Spain, Portugal, France, Lithuania and Sudan, can you add to it? 

#### What matters the most to us?

- Ability to find simple solutions to complex problems
- A passion for quality and strong attention to detail
- Experience with Java or Kotlin
- Aptitude for learning new technologies
- Have an understanding of the principles of computer science
- Hands-on Android engineering experience
- Have published one or more Android apps or be familiar with the app release process from work experience

As you progress to a more experienced engineer, we would also like to see:

- Ability to think and work independently
- Taking ownership of big pieces of work, from the planning phase right the way through to execution and delivery
- Advanced experience in Android development and architecture, including API design techniques
- Experience mentoring junior engineers

And we also have a small nice to have list of things: 
- Making contributions to the Android community, through things like projects on GitHub, blog posts or giving talks
- Knowledge of other languages such as Swift or Scala

#### Interview stages
Our interview is generally split in 3 to 4 parts. An initial phone call, a code challenge to complete at home and 
to finish, a half-day on-site interview where you'll have the opportunity to meet the team and show us your skills.

##### 1. Initial phone call
This consists of a 20/30 minute introductory phone call where we get to know you and understand your background and intentions to join Babylon.
This session is not technical.
 
##### 2. Code challenge
The 2nd stage of our interview process is a coding exercise/challenge, which consists of building a
simple Android application to demonstrate your knowledge around architecture, design patterns and Android UI components.
You can find our code challenge here -> [Android code challenge](code_challenge.md)

If you have a pet project or an open source contribution that you believe demonstrates your knowledge as an Android Engineer,
and you're comfortable sharing it with us, please do and we'll evaluate that instead. It might happen we don't find that enough
and still ask you for the code challenge, so try to send something relevant.

##### 3. Remote interview (Optional)
For people that are not in London, we normally have a video interview before flying you in for the last stage below. This session
is a bit longer than the initial phone call and will involve some technical questions to assess you're the right candidate
for the role. If you're applying for a remote position, this is a good session to discuss your experiences and usual workflow as a remote engineer.

##### 4. On-site interview
This is the last stage of the interview process. It usually takes around half a day and gives both of us the opportunity to know each other better,
and you can also meet and speak with different people on our organisation. This is usually split in 5 small sessions like this:

- **Architecture interview (with 2 Android engineers):** a session around Android architecture, design patterns 
and common libraries used within Android development. [Possible questions](architecture_questions.md)
 
- **UI interview (with 2 different Android engineers):** a session more focused in Android UI and the Android framework 
components. [Possible questions](design_questions.md)

- **Working with Design and Product (with a Designer and a Product manager):** a session about design and product management and how
you generally work and interact with members from both of those teams. 

- **Programming exercise (with the Android Lead):** in this session you'll be given a small problem to solve that will involve 
cloning a code base with the problem skeleton and implementing a solution to make existing tests in the project pass. 
This will be done using Android Studio and the skeleton is written in Kotlin, so preferably your solution
should be written in Kotlin as well. You will need to bring your laptop for this session.

- **Final interview (with the Director of Engineering):** this is the final session and consists of a talk around a general technical topic, like
a previous project you have worked on. You'll also talk about your motivations to join Babylon and your preferred ways of working and what you're
looking for in a company. It's important that you have an active role in this discussion and ask questions back.

We try to maintain the structure order above, but it might be the case where we have to slightly change it due to availability of the participants. In each session you'll have the chance to ask questions as well, so take that opportunity to find out as much as you can about us and the way we work, we'll be happy to answer those questions.

If you like what you read and want to apply, we have a few positions open at the moment:
