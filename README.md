Android Playbook ðŸ“š
==================================

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should
be present in everything we do. This playbook serves as a guide and reference
for anyone wanting to learn more about who we are, what we do, and how we work.
This playbook will continuously be updated as we go, so be sure to check back
often!

## Who are we and what are we working on?

There are currently 32 of us in the Android guild. As an Android Engineer,
you'll be joining a smaller, cross-functional squad made up of Android, iOS,
web and backend engineers. You'll get the chance to collaborate with designers,
product managers and healthcare professionals, tackling complex, exciting
problems daily.

You can check who we are and which squads we're working on below. By definition,
members work on their respective squad, although they are free to work in
different squads if the workload justifies it.

We work across 3 offices, South Kensington (HQ), Liverpool Street, and
Austin TX USA as well as many remote engineers. Your tribe/squad determines your
office location. We have open positions across our offices, links at the end.

We're passionate about our codebase and are always looking for innovative ways
to build fast. All our new code is in Kotlin and we use an MVI architecture with
Rx and Dagger to help us write high-quality, testable code. We currently have
over 20,000 tests and counting!

We embrace open source and are committed to releasing what we can to benefit the
community. For example, we recently launched
[certificate-transparency-android](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/certificate-transparency-android/)
to help everyone better secure SSL connections.

As a team, we love to learn and often participate in Lunch and Learn sessions
with other Android developers and the wider tech community. For example, we've
given talks at droidcon London, droidcon Berlin and Londroid.
