Android Playbook üìö
==================================

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do. This playbook is here to serve as both a guide and reference for the current team, new joiners and for anyone else who want's to learn a little bit more about who are, what we do and how we work.

## Who are we and what are we currently working on?

There are currently 16 of us in the Android team, but as an Android Engineer you'll be joining a smaller, 
cross-functional squad made up of Android, iOS, web and backend engineers.  You'll get the chance to collaborate with designers, product managers and healthcare professionals, tackling complex, exciting problems on a daily basis. 

You can check who we are and which squads we're working on below. By definition, members work on their respective squad, although they are free to work in different squads if the work load justifies it.

We are now split into 2 offices, one in South Kensington (HQ) and another one in Liverpool Street. We have open positions in both locations, links in the end. The distribution between both offices is based on which tribe/squad you work on.

We're passionate about our codebase and are always looking for innovative ways to build fast.  All our new code is written in Kotlin and we use an MVI architecture with Rx and Dagger to help us write high-quality, testable code. We currently have over 11,000 tests and counting!

As a team, we love to learn and often participate in Lunch and Learn sessions with other Android developers and the wider tech community. For example we've given talks at Droidcon London and Londroid.
