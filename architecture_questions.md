- Sealed classes and its advantages
- Nested class vs inner nested class
- Mutability

#### Architecture and Design Patterns:
- MVP, MVVM and MVI
- Main differences and which one do you prefer and why?
- Tell us about your current project architecture
- Design patterns: builders, factories...

#### RxJava
- Operators: map, flatmap, switchmap...
- subscribeOn vs observeOn
- RxJava vs Coroutines

#### Clean Architecture:
- What is clean architecture and what is the benefit of it?  
- Can you explain the different layers? Draw a diagram to explain the layers.
- What are the layers in clean architecture for android?
- How do you handle the Android dependency for each layer?
